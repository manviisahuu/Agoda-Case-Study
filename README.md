# Agoda Case Study: Optimizing Urgency Messaging to Boost Bookings

 ## Project Overview
This project analyzes booking behavior and pricing trends on Agoda, a leading travel booking platform, to optimize urgency messaging and improve booking conversion rates. The goal is to provide data-driven insights and actionable strategies that help increase customer engagement and revenue.

*Business Problem*
Agoda faces challenges such as:
* Missed revenue due to delayed bookings.
* Lack of urgency among customers.
* Unclear understanding of price movement trends.
* External and internal factors influencing booking behavior.

Objective: Analyze historical booking data to uncover insights that can support the development of effective urgency messaging strategies.

### Dataset Description
Rows: 49,064
Columns: 13
Source: Provided internally (simulated for case study)

## Key Data Cleaning & Preprocessing Steps:
* Handled null/missing values.
* Merged necessary sheets and columns.
* Performed feature engineering (e.g., lead time calculation).

## Key Analysis & Insights
1. Price Distribution of Bookings
Most bookings fall in the $10â€“$100 range.
High-value customers are fewer and may require premium benefits or dynamic pricing strategies.

2. Booking Patterns by Lead Time
Over 10,000 users booked within 10â€“15 days before check-in.
62% of bookings were late, followed by 19% mid-term, and 18% early.
*Opportunity: Tailored urgency messages for short lead times can drive last-minute conversions.*

3. Average Daily Rate (ADR) Trends
Late bookers pay less than early bookers, suggesting last-minute discounts are being offered.
ADR remains relatively stable, contradicting the assumption that prices always rise closer to check-in.

4. Accommodation Type Trends
Hotels, hostels, and serviced apartments see higher bookings.
*Suggests that discounted urgency messaging should be tested more on low-performing property types.*

5. Seasonal Price Trends
November shows a dip in ADR.
*Suggestion: Implement seasonal promotional campaigns during low-demand months.*

## Recommendations
*Strategic Recommendations:*
* Launch seasonal promotions based on ADR trends.
* Use urgency messaging for shorter lead times (e.g., <15 days).
* Offer discounts on low-booking accommodation types.
* Introduce personalized messaging based on user behavior.
* Use recommendation systems to suggest similar properties.

### Urgency Message Examples are given in the ppt and Urgency messages should always be backed by real-time data to maintain trust and transparency.

## Tools & Technologies
* Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
* Jupyter Notebook
* PowerPoint (Presentation & Business Communication)

ðŸ“Œ Conclusion
This case study delivers actionable insights to help Agoda optimize its marketing and pricing strategy using urgency-based messaging. Through detailed EDA, pricing behavior analysis, and customer segmentation, we provide clear steps to boost conversion and reduce missed revenue opportunities.
